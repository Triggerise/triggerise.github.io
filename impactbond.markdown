Our goal: reduce teen pregnancy and HIV infections among Kenyan girls aged 15-19

Universal access to HIV prevention and treatment for Kenyan girls aged 15-19.
<br><br>
How? By increasing access to and uptake of quality, girl-rated, sexual health and reproductive services and products.
<br><br>
Despite the Covid-19 pandemic that halted the globe, we delivered. Our targets were reached months ahead of schedule, and we served a quarter of a million girls with sexual and reproductive health services.
<br><br>
Because of this unprecedented achievement, we're gearing up to do even more. 
<br><br>
For this new phase of the Development Impact Bond, Kenyan UN agencies and the national government have come on board with us.
<br><br>
Alongside them, we have also secured investors who provide the working capital we need to serve adolescents.

Join a growing group of organisations who are committed to seeing lives change for the better.

    **Powerful collaborations**
    ![lady-050119.jpg](/uploads/lady-050119.jpg)
    We connected our donor organisation the C​hi​ldren’s Investment Fund Foundation (CIFF), Kenyian social mobilisers Shujaaz Inc and Marie Stopes Kenya (MSK) to build 145 ecosystems across the country. These ecosystems are made of pharmacies, retailers, on-the-ground mobilisers and clinics, jointly aiming to improve the sexual and reproductive health and prevent unwanted pregnancies for 15-19 year old girls.

    While CIFF supplied the funding, team Triggerise were busy on the ground and Shujaaz Inc launched a campaign to drive self-enrolment. In the meantime, MSK was instrumental in ensuring the quality of our supply of products and services to all the local ecosystems. We’re team players at heart and our far-reaching impact is made possible through co-creation.


    Enabling informed choices
    Our ecosystems connect girls to sexual and reproductive health (SRH) services in three ways:

    • By sparking genuine demand
    through knowledge: with access to information, girls learn about the possibilities of taking control of their SRH.

    • By increasing access to and choice of quality SRH products and services.

    • By generating a positive mindset in the community around girls making informed choices about their SRH.

    Agile and effective impact with real-time data

  Body: "**Real-time data and powerful collaborations**\n![TRIGGERISE-KIBERA-139.jpg](/uploads/TRIGGERISE-KIBERA-139.jpg)\nFunded
    by the Children’s Investment Fund Foundation (CIFF), In Their Hands (ITH) project
    has connected 319,228 girls to 336,931 SRH services and products across Kenya
    in 3 years. We built 145 ecosystems in 19 counties of Kenya. These ecosystems
    are made of pharmacies, retailers, on-the-ground mobilisers and clinics, jointly
    aiming to improve the sexual and reproductive health and prevent unwanted pregnancies
    for 15-19 year old girls.\nOur approach towards this objective has been of iterative
    improvements - learning from the data our members generate and feeding it back
    into our platform to make it more user-centric every step forward. Access to real-time
    data and further drawing insights from interactive dashboards based on this data
    allowed us to improve our platforms in three ways – \n-\tOptimising nudges based
    on member behaviour\n-\tAddressing risk management issues\n-\tMaintaining the
    quality and relevance of services offered \n\nThe visibility into the real-time
    performance of our interventions brings transparency and agility to our programme.
    Making every actor and member accountable and also providing evidence of impact
    on a real-time basis has offered complete transparency to our donors on the operations
    and performance of the programme. Simultaneously, accessible insights also facilitate
    collaborative and agile decision-making by the stakeholders that are required
    for continuous fine-tuning of complex interventions like this; elevating donor
    relationship to a partner relationship. \nITH has been our flagship programme
    that demonstrated that relevant impact at scale is possible by deploying technology
    and behavioural sciences principles.\n"

    Half a million teenage girls in Kenya now have easy access to contraceptives and

- Title: Delivering evidence-based impact in Kenya
  Image: "/uploads/TRIGGERISE%20KIBERA%20139.jpg"
  Body: "**Real-time data and powerful collaborations**\n![TRIGGERISE-KIBERA-139.jpg](/uploads/TRIGGERISE-KIBERA-139.jpg)\nFunded
    by the Children’s Investment Fund Foundation (CIFF), In Their Hands (ITH) project
    has connected 319,228 girls to 336,931 SRH services and products across Kenya
    in 3 years. We built 145 ecosystems in 19 counties of Kenya. These ecosystems
    are made of pharmacies, retailers, on-the-ground mobilisers and clinics, jointly
    aiming to improve the sexual and reproductive health and prevent unwanted pregnancies
    for 15-19 year-old girls.\nOur approach towards this objective has been of iterative
    improvements - learning from the data our members generate and feeding it back
    into our platform to make it more user-centric every step forward. Access to real-time
    data and further drawing insights from interactive dashboards based on this data
    allowed us to improve our platforms in three ways – \n-\tOptimising nudges based
    on member behaviour\n-\tAddressing risk management issues\n-\tMaintaining the
    quality and relevance of services offered \n\nThe visibility into the real-time
    performance of our interventions brings transparency and agility to our programme.
    Making every actor and member accountable and also providing evidence of impact
    on a real-time basis has offered complete transparency to our donors on the operations
    and performance of the programme. Simultaneously, accessible insights also facilitate
    collaborative and agile decision-making by the stakeholders that are required
    for continuous fine-tuning of complex interventions like this; elevating donor
    relationship to a partner relationship. \nITH has been our flagship programme
    that demonstrated that relevant impact at scale is possible by deploying technology
    and behavioural sciences principles.\n"

    Half a million teenage girls in Kenya now have easy access to contraceptives and

- Title: Inspiring entrepreneurship to trigger change in India
  Image: "/uploads/Triggerise-TikoPro.jpg"
  Body: "**Last-mile connectivity and entrepreneurial ambitions**\n![Triggerise-TikoPro
    (1).jpg](/uploads/Triggerise-TikoPro%20(1).jpg)\nSince 2016, around 3,500* Tiko
    Pro mobilisers in India have played a crucial role in connecting over 85,000*
    young mothers and girls to approximately 145,000* antenatal and SRH services.
    Tiko Pro is a key feature of the Tiko platform that motivates community members
    to pursue their entrepreneurial aspirations. More importantly, Tiko Pro mobilisers
    also act as agents of change from within the community in our mission to drive
    positive behaviour change. Income made through activities, such as sales and promotions
    of subsidised products or referrals to enrol members and other mobilisers on the
    Tiko platform, support the Tiko Pro mobilisers in realising their economic aspirations.
    Motivated by extra income, simple app-based management of activities, ability
    to customise product mix offered and flexibility to work at their own pace, Tiko
    Pro mobilisers actively reach out to the underserved members of their communities
    and connect them to various healthcare services through our platform. \n\nIn India,
    Tiko Pro mobilisers contribute the most to new member enrolments on Tiko. Earning
    rewards for each enrolment and flexible income earned of around €19** per month
    by offering maternal healthcare, nutrition and other fast-moving consumer goods
    (FMCG) like sanitary pads for sale in their local communities and by referring
    young women from these communities to Tiko.\nOwing to the sensitivities inherent
    to the sexual and reproductive healthcare sector, demand creation for SRH products
    and services amongst the most impenetrable sections of the communities is challenging.
    The indispensable nature of Pro mobilisers in our ecosystems becomes apparent
    for a comprehensive approach to demand creation. In India, community health workers
    called ASHA support us as Pro mobilisers to address the demand gap as they go
    door-to-door, motivating young women to aspire for better health and future. Already
    respected by community women and families, Pro mobilisers in India are also often
    accepted as trusted counsellors and confidants by many of the young women in their
    communities.\n\nTiko Pro enables our platform to connect and engage with the most
    under-served individuals of the community through the community itself. Across
    all our markets, Tiko Pro mobilisers are supporting us to trigger positive behaviour
    change with their hard-work and their thorough understanding of the communities.
    In return, we support them in their pursuit of economic empowerment. Apart from
    unlocking immediate economic opportunities for its mobilisers through a mobile
    application, Tiko also focuses on the sustainability of this economic momentum.
    We continuously expand our ecosystems with a growing list of partners, products
    and services to foster long-term active engagement with the Pro mobilisers. With
    199* Tiko Pro mobilisers in India choosing to uninterruptedly support us in our
    endeavour since 2016, our instinct and experience tells us that change is indeed
    triggered from within. \n\n*As of Oct 2020, 85,000 young mother and girls to 144,703
    antenatal and SRH products and services since 2016\n\n**Monthly average earning
    since 2016"

  Intro text: Affectionately referred to as ‘Pro Didi’ (Pro sister) by Tiko members
    in India, the Tiko Pro mobilisers are actively driving health and wellbeing change
    from within the communities. From door-to-door mobilisation to stepping into the
    shoes of an elder sister, here’s how a Tiko Pro triggers positive behaviour change.

description: "Triggerise Stichting (the Foundation), incorporated on 29 October 2014
  is a non-profit institution for the public benefit with ANBI-registration in the
  Netherlands, as is apparent from\nthe Foundation’s statutes in the Triggerise Stichting
  Articles of Incorporation and from the actual work planned and implemented by the
  Foundation.\n\n**Management of the Foundation**\n\nPursuant to the Foundation’s
  Articles of Incorporation and its actual activities, no individual person or legal
  entity shall have decisive control. Thus no individual person or legal entity\ncan
  dispose of the Institution’s assets as if they were their own. On the basis of Article
  8 of the Articles of Incorporation (provision regarding the decision-making by the
  executive board\nand supervisory board) and its actual efficacy has no person with
  decisive influence within the Foundation. The Supervisory Board consists of seven
  members and is chaired by Lisa Simutami.\n\n**Vision and mission**\n\nVision: Our
  vision is a world where all youth have the power to choose where, when, and how
  they meet their sexual reproductive health needs.\n\nMission: Our mission is to
  be a next-generation non-profit that is exponentially more efficient at delivering
  scalable and verified sexual reproductive health (SRH) impact for sub-Saharan\nAfrican
  youth.\n\n**Statutory framework**\n\n**Article 2. Objects**\n\n2\\.1 The objects
  of the Foundation are to create, foster, invest and/or manage businesses and philanthropic
  solutions to underserved market segments worldwide.\n\n2\\.2 The Foundation seeks
  to realize its objects, inter alia, by:\n\n1.  raising funds and donations from
  partners, authorities, foundations, associations,institutions, individuals and companies,
  by means of, among other things, direct requests, publicity, campaigns, and the
  origination of fundraising activities and promotions;\n\n\n1.  managing and using
  such funds, donations and any other income for the realisation of the objective
  described above, through investments into and/or donations to various initiatives
  worldwide, and the activities referred to in this article;\n\n\n1.  consulting,
  supporting and cooperating with organisations, individuals and institutions that
  support the objective described above;\n\n\n1. any and all things that may be conducive
  to the realisation of the objective described above, in the broadest sense of the
  word.\n\n2\\.3 The funds of the Foundation consist of grants, donations, bequests,
  assets obtained from testamentary dispositions and other benefits.\n\n2\\.4 The
  Foundation serves the public interest and does not aim to make a profit.\n\n**Strategic
  focus areas**\n\n* **Scalable delivery model**: Our goal is to become the go-to
  delivery model for SRH in Sub Saharan Africa. We aim to scale in 5 key countries
  - Kenya, Ethiopia, Uganda, Burkina Faso, and South Africa - by replicating the blueprint
  of our Kenya operations and ensuring we continue to provide the best value for money
  to our donors.\n\n\n* **Trusted Results**: In 3 years, we aim to be a leading player
  in the verification of outputs and outcomes. We will implement scalable and cost-efficient
  risk management processes by design in all markets and invest in technology to automate
  and strengthen our risk capabilities.\n\n\n* **Driven by insights**: Our goal is
  to become thought leaders on adolescent SRH. We will do this by building a culture
  that promotes data-driven decision-making, by empowering anyone to uncover insights
  in our data, and finally by being recognised\n  for our data-driven approach.\n\n\n*
  **Sustainable growth**: : By 2025, we will have sustainably increased our revenue
  to reach an annual budget of €26m. We will focus on attracting large grants and
  core funding, positioning Triggerise for outcome-based funds, and building Triggerise\n
  \ Ventures, an enterprise testing the commercial viability of the Tiko platform.\n\n\n*
  **Becoming Tiko**: Our goal is to be a future-ready organization that continues
  to be adaptive and fast-moving for sustained success. We will transform Triggerise’s
  legal and governance structure, improve our programme delivery by favoring simplicity,and
  nurture organizational flexibility and learning.\n\n**Work performed by the Foundation**\n\n*
  Our digital platform nudges individuals to adopt and maintain positive behaviours
  by enabling their access to products, services, and information. We use nudges like
  reminders, discounts, in person and digital follow-ups, and reward points to\n  encourage
  our users to access and use healthy products, services and information.\n\n\n* We
  facilitate online and offline interactions between our users and ecosystem partners
  - last mile mobilizers, retail shops, pharmacies, and healthcare providers - in
  the most innovative and cost-effective way.\n\n\n* We use data, insights, and behavioural
  science to constantly evolve with our users’needs and provide them with personalized
  choices that deliver better health and well-being outcomes. Our technology manages
  dynamic, real-world interactions every second of every day that produce health and
  wellbeing benefits to our users.\n\n**Method of fundraising**\n\nOur fundraising
  strategy is to raise at least Eur 23.5 million between 2021 and 2025 to ensure that
  we can achieve our mission. Our strategy is focused on: (1) building our internal
  capacity to raise and mobilize funds; (2) raising additional funds from existing
  donors and partners through contract extensions or presenting new opportunities
  for their consideration (3) Pivoting our operational model to ensure that it is
  more cost efficient and (4) Developing relationships with new funders that are aligned
  and interested in supporting us to achieve our strategic priorities and to diversify
  our funding sources\n\n**The administration of income and funds**\n\nThe recording
  of income, expenditure, assets and liabilities is administered in the ERP(enterprise
  resource planning), Netsuite. The Foundation’s consolidated financial statements
  for the year ended 31 December 2022 were audited by KPMG, an independent audit firm
  of Triggerise Stichting in accordance with the ‘Verordening inzake de onafhankelijkheid
  van accountants bij assurance opdrachten’ (ViO, Code of Ethics for Professional
  Accountants, a regulation with respect to independence) and other relevant independence
  regulations in the Netherlands. The audit was conducted in accordance with Dutch
  law, including the Dutch\nStandards on Auditing.\n\n**How income and funds will
  be spent and to which objectives**\n\n2022 was the last phase of our 3-year strategic
  plan. In 2022, we developed a new strategic plan with 5 focus areas as noted in
  earlier sections of this report. We are looking to scale our\ndelivery model across
  our core markets, become a leading player in the verification of outputs and outcomes,
  become thought leaders on adolescent SRH and build a culture that promotes data-driven
  decision-making, sustainably increasing our revenue to reach an annual budget of
  €26 million and be a future-ready organization that continues to be adaptive and
  fast-moving for sustained success. In 2022, we signed new funding contracts\nand
  grant agreements worth €3.863 million which will be spent in accordance with the
  respective agreements.\n\nThe 2023 annual operating budget of EUR 12,382,053 was
  presented, discussed and approved by the Supervisory board at the meeting held on
  9 December 2022.\n\n**Organisation**\n\nName: Triggerise Stichting\n\nRSIN: 854488315\n\nKvK:

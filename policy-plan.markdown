  and supervisory board) and its actual efficacy has no person with decisive influence within the Foundation. The Supervisory Board consists of seven members and is chaired by Lisa Simutami.

  **Strategic focus areas**

  • **Scalable delivery model**: Our goal is to become the go-to delivery model for SRH in Sub Saharan Africa. We aim to scale in 5 key countries - Kenya, Ethiopia, Uganda, Burkina Faso, and South Africa - by replicating the blueprint of our Kenya operations and ensuring we continue to provide the best value for money to our donors.

  • **Trusted Results**: In 3 years, we aim to be a leading player in the verification of outputs and outcomes. We will implement scalable and cost-efficient risk management processes by design in all markets and invest in technology to automate and strengthen our risk capabilities.

  • **Driven by insights**: Our goal is to become thought leaders on adolescent SRH. We will do this by building a culture that promotes data-driven decision-making, by empowering anyone to uncover insights in our data, and finally by being recognised
  for our data-driven approach.

  • **Sustainable growth**: : By 2025, we will have sustainably increased our revenue to reach an annual budget of €26m. We will focus on attracting large grants and core funding, positioning Triggerise for outcome-based funds, and building Triggerise
  Ventures, an enterprise testing the commercial viability of the Tiko platform.

  • **Becoming Tiko**: Our goal is to be a future-ready organization that continues to be adaptive and fast-moving for sustained success. We will transform Triggerise’s legal and governance structure, improve our programme delivery by favoring simplicity,and nurture organizational flexibility and learning.

  **Work performed by the Foundation**

  • Our digital platform nudges individuals to adopt and maintain positive behaviours by enabling their access to products, services, and information. We use nudges like reminders, discounts, in person and digital follow-ups, and reward points to
  encourage our users to access and use healthy products, services and information.

  • We facilitate online and offline interactions between our users and ecosystem partners - last mile mobilizers, retail shops, pharmacies, and healthcare providers - in the most innovative and cost-effective way.

  • We use data, insights, and behavioural science to constantly evolve with our users’needs and provide them with personalized choices that deliver better health and well-being outcomes. Our technology manages dynamic, real-world interactions every second of every day that produce health and wellbeing benefits to our users.

  **Method of fundraising**

  Our fundraising strategy is to raise at least Eur 23.5 million between 2021 and 2025 to ensure that we can achieve our mission. Our strategy is focused on: (1) building our internal capacity to raise and mobilize funds; (2) raising additional funds from existing donors and partners through contract extensions or presenting new opportunities for their consideration (3) Pivoting our operational model to ensure that it is more cost efficient and (4) Developing relationships with new funders that are aligned and interested in supporting us to achieve our strategic priorities and to diversify our funding sources

  **The administration of income and funds**

  The recording of income, expenditure, assets and liabilities is administered in the ERP(enterprise resource planning), Netsuite. The Foundation’s consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2022 were audited by KPMG, an independent audit firm of Triggerise Stichting in accordance with the ‘Verordening inzake de onafhankelijkheid van accountants bij assurance opdrachten’ (ViO, Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants, a regulation with respect to independence) and other relevant independence regulations in the Netherlands. The audit was conducted in accordance with Dutch law, including the Dutch
  Standards on Auditing.

  **How income and funds will be spent and to which objectives**

  2022 was the last phase of our 3-year strategic plan. In 2022, we developed a new strategic plan with 5 focus areas as noted in earlier sections of this report. We are looking to scale our
  delivery model across our core markets, become a leading player in the verification of outputs and outcomes, become thought leaders on adolescent SRH and build a culture that promotes data-driven decision-making, sustainably increasing our revenue to reach an annual budget of €26 million and be a future-ready organization that continues to be adaptive and fast-moving for sustained success. In 2022, we signed new funding contracts
  and grant agreements worth €3.863 million which will be spent in accordance with the respective agreements.

  The 2023 annual operating budget of EUR 12,382,053 was presented, discussed and approved by the Supervisory board at the meeting held on 9 December 2022.

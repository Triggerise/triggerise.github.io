I"©<p><strong>Powerful collaborations</strong>
<img src="/uploads/TRIGGERISE-KIBERA-139.jpg" alt="TRIGGERISE-KIBERA-139.jpg" />
We connected our donor organisation the Câ€‹hiâ€‹ldrenâ€™s Investment Fund Foundation (CIFF), Kenyian social mobilisers Shujaaz Inc and Marie Stopes Kenya (MSK) to build 145 ecosystems across the country. These ecosystems are made of pharmacies, retailers, on-the-ground mobilisers and clinics, jointly aiming to improve the sexual and reproductive health and prevent unwanted pregnancies for 15-19 year old girls.</p>

<p>While CIFF supplied the funding, team Triggerise were busy on the ground and Shujaaz Inc launched a campaign to drive self-enrolment. In the meantime, MSK was instrumental in ensuring the quality of our supply of products and services to all the local ecosystems. Weâ€™re team players at heart and our far-reaching impact is made possible through co-creation.</p>

<p>Enabling informed choices
Our ecosystems connect girls to sexual and reproductive health (SRH) services in three ways:</p>

<p>â€¢ By sparking genuine demand
through knowledge: with access to information, girls learn about the possibilities of taking control of their SRH.</p>

<p>â€¢ By increasing access to and choice of quality SRH products and services.</p>

<p>â€¢ By generating a positive mindset in the community around girls making informed choices about their SRH.</p>

<p>Agile and effective impact with real-time data</p>

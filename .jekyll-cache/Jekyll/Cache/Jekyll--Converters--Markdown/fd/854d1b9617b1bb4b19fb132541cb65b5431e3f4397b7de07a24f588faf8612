I"Ü<p>Tiko connects across supply and demand, building networks of donors, local services and communities to deliver joined-up health services on the ground.</p>

<p>Our ecosystems are made up of highly diverse actors, from pharmacies to beauty salons to local shops.  Being connected through our platform means that each supplier can do what they do even better and are rewarded for it. It also allows us to integrate multiple programmes into one, so Tiko can offer anything from medical consultations to contraceptives, STI test-kits to vocational training to motivate our members.</p>

<p>Through our role as a connector, we ensure our services are relevant and we boost local economies wherever we go. Our signature ecosystem approach means we leverage expertise, funds and infrastructure to scale fast.</p>

<p>Our ecosystems are at varying stages of maturity from nascent projects in Burkino Faso to established programmes in India. In Kenya for example, we are currently operating 145 such ecosystems which have helped us serve 268,226 adolescent girls with contraceptive products and services, in just the last two and a half years - making it one of the most impactful health programmes in East Africa (ITH impact report, 2015-2019).</p>

Since 2016, around 3,500* Tiko Pro mobilisers in India have played a crucial role in connecting over 85,000* young mothers and girls to approximately 145,000* antenatal and SRH services. Tiko Pro is a key feature of the Tiko platform that motivates community members to pursue their entrepreneurial aspirations. More importantly, Tiko Pro mobilisers also act as agents of change from within the community in our mission to drive positive behaviour change. Income made through activities, such as sales and promotions of subsidised products or referrals to enrol members and other mobilisers on the Tiko platform, support the Tiko Pro mobilisers in realising their economic aspirations. Motivated by extra income, simple app-based management of activities, ability to customise product mix offered and flexibility to work at their own pace, Tiko Pro mobilisers actively reach out to the underserved members of their communities and connect them to various healthcare services through our platform.</p>

<p>In India, Tiko Pro mobilisers contribute the most to new member enrolments on Tiko. Earning rewards for each enrolment and flexible income earned of around â‚¬19** per month by offering maternal healthcare, nutrition and other fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) like sanitary pads for sale in their local communities and by referring young women from these communities to Tiko.
Owing to the sensitivities inherent to the sexual and reproductive healthcare sector, demand creation for SRH products and services amongst the most impenetrable sections of the communities is challenging. The indispensable nature of Pro mobilisers in our ecosystems becomes apparent for a comprehensive approach to demand creation. In India, community health workers called ASHA support us as Pro mobilisers to address the demand gap as they go door-to-door, motivating young women to aspire for better health and future. Already respected by community women and families, Pro mobilisers in India are also often accepted as trusted counsellors and confidants by many of the young women in their communities.</p>

<p>Tiko Pro enables our platform to connect and engage with the most under-served individuals of the community through the community itself. Across all our markets, Tiko Pro mobilisers are supporting us to trigger positive behaviour change with their hard-work and their thorough understanding of the communities. In return, we support them in their pursuit of economic empowerment. Apart from unlocking immediate economic opportunities for its mobilisers through a mobile application, Tiko also focuses on the sustainability of this economic momentum. We continuously expand our ecosystems with a growing list of partners, products and services to foster long-term active engagement with the Pro mobilisers. With 199* Tiko Pro mobilisers in India choosing to uninterruptedly support us in our endeavour since 2016, our instinct and experience tells us that change is indeed triggered from within.</p>

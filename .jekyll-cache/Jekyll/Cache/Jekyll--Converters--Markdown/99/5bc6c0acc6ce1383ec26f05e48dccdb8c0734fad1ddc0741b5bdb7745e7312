We connect our members’ needs to existing local providers, by building ecosystems of local health services, community organisations and micro-entrepreneurs. With this diversity of actors we’re able to create impact at scale.</h3>

<p>Powered by behavioural economics, we use nudge tools including reminders, follow-ups, subsidies and instant rewards to motivate our members. From manicures to contraceptives, Tiko offers a broad range of wellbeing products and services to foster long-lasting healthy behaviours. Currently we connect primarily adolescent girls and young mothers to a variety of sexual and reproductive health (SRH) services and antenatal care (ANC) from local providers.</p>

postContent: "<p>We are delighted to share that the Dutch Postcode Lottery (Nationale
  Postcode Loterij) has awarded a €1.5m grant to Triggerise for us to continue and
  expand our work in positively impacting the lives of youths in the eight countries
  we operate in. This is a three-year grant, and it will enable us to invest time
  and resources into addressing and executing several key strategic priorities.</p>
  <h4><b>Partnering for impact</b></h4> <p>As a nonprofit, Triggerise can only make
  an impact when others believe in us. As a team, we are grateful for the investment
  that the Dutch Postcode Lottery has made to enable us to keep making the unique
  intervention that we offer and in recognising the dynamic nature of our work. Firstly,
  we will be able to do more for the health and wellness of the communities we serve.
  Secondly, resources will be allotted to a training programme called the Tiko Academy;
  this programme will train up local organisations and provide them with tailored
  information to help them impact their communities more strategically. Finally, as
  a team who uses behavioural economics principles (nudges, incentives, reminders,
  and more) to make impact, we’ll be using this grant to scale up our activities in
  this area. In this way, we’ll be able to leverage even more behavioural sciences
  principles across our programmes that motivate positive behaviour change.</p> <p>This
  is our first opportunity to work with the Dutch Postcode Lottery, which is itself
  a one-of-a-kind organisation that has contributed over six billion euros to global
  charities since 1990. “We are very happy to be able to support Triggerise’s innovative
  tech-based approaches to help young people to make positive life decisions and foster
  long-lasting healthy behaviours,” says Dorine Manson, Managing Director of the Dutch
  Postcode Lottery.</p> <p>As neighbourhoods are demarcated by postcode, local communities
  purchase lottery tickets and win together. Through this grant, these participating
  Dutch families and friends will have a direct impact on the health and wellbeing
  of families and friends around the world that Triggerise reaches. Responding to
  the news, Triggerise co-founder and CEO Benoit Renard says, “We are grateful to
  the Dutch Postcode Lottery for its support for this vital and life-changing work.
  Thanks to this funding, Triggerise and our partners will be able to scale services
  to thousands of youth in some of the world’s poorest and most marginalised communities.”</p>
  <h4><b>Where to from here?</b></h4> <p>We have existing projects in multiple countries
  across the globe and strategies to establish more in new territories. Our current
  programmes all use our signature ecosystems of healthcare providers, shopkeepers,
  and community mobilisers to encourage youth to make positive choices in the areas
  of sexual and reproductive health, skills-building for employment, and mental health.
  Bolstered by this grant from the Dutch Postcode Lottery, we are confident that we
  will be able to strengthen our offering, scale our unique model, and connect more
  underserved communities with the health and wellbeing resources that they need.</p>"

From the 14th to 17th of November 2022, a team from Triggerise will be at the ICFP in Thailand. This is the biggest conference on family planning and reproductive health worldwide, and we are glad to represent Triggerise there.

Over the week, hundreds of speakers, sessions, and presentations will take place. We’ll be hosting our own side event on Wednesday night, please see the invitation included and join us virtually or online.

Three abstracts from Triggerise were selected for wider distribution, and we’re proud of all our people who contributed to them. Scroll through for the posters we prepared for the conference that distil the abstracts into a more visual format. Each abstract has also been included for further reading.

**Using behavioural science to support contraceptive strategies for adolescent girls and young women**

Authored by: Tristan von Zahn, Rodwell Ndlovu, Jesse Njunguru, Richard Matikanya, Benoit Renard, and Martha Brady

All adolescent girls and young women make decisions based on unique sets of internal and external influences. This abstract explores what sexual and reproductive health programmes can do to support these young people in their decision-making.

**Driving provider accountability and improvements in the quality of contraceptive services provided to adolescent girls and young women through the use of ratings**

Authored by: Richard Matikanya and Rodwell Ndlovu

In existing pharmacy networks in Kenya, transparency and accountability are limited. Currently, providers have little incentive to address the quality gaps in service delivery to adolescent girls and young women. In this abstract, we explore how implementing a ratings system drives accountability and increases agency among youth.

**Utilising mobile digital platforms to connect adolescent girls and young women to subsidised contraception in pharmacies in Kenya**

Authored by: Richard Matikanya and Benoit Renard

In Kenya, pharmacies offer easy access to contraceptive methods from trained staff in the heart of communities. They are a safe haven for people seeking advice, especially in service-deprived areas. However, affordability and inconsistent quality of counselling results in pharmacies being under-utilised. This abstract explores how digital platforms and an innovative approach to supply and demand of products from pharmacies would benefit youth in these neighbourhoods.

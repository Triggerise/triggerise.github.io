postContent: '<p>Every year, International Women’s Day dawns with fresh hope for the sisters, friends, and mothers around the world. There is no country where women don’t face some kind of challenge in their everyday lives, but there is also no country where there isn’t some kind of action being taken to face those challenges. In our work every single day, girls and women are at the forefront of all our actions. From each line of code written and every cent raised springs a shared goal: improving the lives of women and those around them.</p>

<p>Our monthly Friday “after-work drinks” (a bit tricky to coordinate across all our time zones when one person’s 4pm is someone else’s lunchtime) were dedicated to celebrating all the women in our own team. We spent the time sharing and listening to different perspectives on what it means to be a woman, illustrating and discussing the many strengths of women, diving into quotes immortalised by women, and rounded up with reflecting on what had been shared in the broader session and various breakout rooms.</p>

<p>A shoutout goes to two women at Triggerise who were consistently named in the session as women our team particularly appreciated: Gabriella Garnett, our astute Learning and Development Lead, and Sharon Muchemwa, our contagiously kind Resourcer.</p>

<p>At Triggerise, these monthly get-togethers are a way for the team to unwind at the end of a week, get to know one another on a more personal level, and have a bit of fun in the process. But every now and then, the jokes and banter are infused with poignancy as we share experiences, ideals, and aspirations. So, from our team to you, we wish you a happy International Women’s Day. Join us and millions of others as we do what we can to break the cycles of poverty, abuse, and stigma that women and girls around the globe are subject to.</p>'

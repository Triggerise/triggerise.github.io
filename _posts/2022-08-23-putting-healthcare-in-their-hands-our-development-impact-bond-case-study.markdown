From September 2020 to February 2022, the world’s first adolescent sexual and reproductive health (SRH) development impact bond (DIB) was implemented in Kenya. In partnership with the [Foreign, Commonwealth, and Development Office](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/foreign-commonwealth-development-office) (FCDO) and the [Children’s Investment Fund Foundation](https://ciff.org/) (CIFF), we contributed to the reduction of unwanted pregnancies among Kenyan adolescent girls through increasing their access to and uptake of SRH services and products.

The [Government Outcomes Lab](https://golab.bsg.ox.ac.uk/) (GO Lab) showcases the knowledge bank of global social development programmes. The case study for our DIB (also known as the ‘In Their Hands’ project) has been published on the GO Lab website, and we invite you to read it in all its depth [here](https://golab.bsg.ox.ac.uk/knowledge-bank/case-studies/in-their-hands/#recommendations).

When attempting to innovate, it is easy to fall into the trap of jumping straight to proposing a solution before fully understanding what the problem is. It is, however, very often the gap between the issue and the answer where the real game-changers are found.


The Innovation Sandbox, made possible with funding from our donors, the Children’s Investment Fund Foundation (CIFF), is designed to actively create an opportunity to break from day-to-day routines of work and focus on ideation. Historically, it has been a challenge for us to pilot technology integrations since a proof-of-concept phase often comes a t a cost with the technology provider. The greatest uncertainty lies in operational implementation and user adoption, so in order to ensure we are hitting our agenda, we need to test our assumptions in a real-world setting.


The internal launch of the Innovation Sandbox was held in Nairobi on the 28th and 29th of September in a two-day event that brought members of our Product, Support, Engineering and Finance teams from South Africa, Portugal and beyond together with operational staff from across Kenya. Our dedicated tech teams regularly work on improvements from real-time data generated by our Tiko platform. Rather than jump to predetermined solutions based on theory, the Innovation Sandbox launch allowed us to actively listen to what our partners and service users say is best for them. By consciously taking time to explore various facets of the problem before compiling a solution, we are able to meaningfully connect data insights to real life.

To achieve this, rather than building a full product, we start with a prototype concept, or a minimum viable product. During day one, multi-departmental teams tackled two theoretical challenges, namely ‘how might we increase footfall to providers?’ and ‘how might we increase retention and performance of mobilisers on the platform?’ Ideas from more rapid and efficient payment methods, to mobiliser motivation schemes, to testing feedback loops in the app were mooted as possible improvements. The four teams on the second day then took their ideas to Machakos County, Kenya to trial them within Triggerise’s ecosystem. The teams met with three service providers and 12 Tiko mobilisers who support our provision of sexual reproductive health services for adolescents.


The results were fascinating; for two of the groups the ideas were consolidated and confirmed through user interactions. For the other two groups, however, the problem they envisaged was not what they discovered to be the core issue in reality. One group, for example, found that the greatest concern for the service provider they engaged with was not the tech as they had originally anticipated, but was in fact staff turnover. The focus of solution-seeking changed from tech streamlining, to how to incentivise clinic staff to stay for longer.

The exercise highlighted the importance of open-mindedness, and that assumptions are challenged through interaction. It was evident that quick fixes can have a big impact, and that fostering positive relationships plays a critical role in making this possible. It demonstrated how important in-house communication is to improving our internal performance, and also the value of promoting closer external collaboration in designing interventions by bringing in actors across the complete ecosystem.
The biggest learning for many participants was the process itself; and the first-hand experience that solutions lie with the users. The activity served to focus our innovation agenda, creating real-life improvements to our services for the end users. By the end of the venture, two of the regional teams had already structured quarterly replica events into their working calendars in order to maintain the momentum.


The Innovation Sandbox is about taking intentional steps to tackling problems, and, through incremental trial and error in controlled environments, finding the big issues that will help us to continuously improve. At Triggerise, we have existing ecosystem infrastructures that are ideal spaces for such innovation. The success of the launch event positions us to open the Innovation Sandbox up to collaborators who, facilitated by us, can test solutions to development problems in this real-world setting.
